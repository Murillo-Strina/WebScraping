# WebScraping

Repository containing all the code I developed while learning this area of programming. It includes small scripts used for practice and logic building, as well as a final project.

The final project is a Hex Color Finder. Using the libraries I learned throughout this journey, I developed a script that searches for and displays the color corresponding to a given hex code. The executable for this project is named HexCodeColors.exe.
